## 🧠 Model Architectures

### 🔍 Text Detection

These models detect regions of text in images or documents:

- **DBNet** — Real-time scene text detection with differentiable binarization
- **LinkNet** — Efficient and lightweight semantic segmentation model
- **FAST** — Fast, arbitrarily-shaped text detector with minimalist kernels

### 🔤 Text Recognition

Once text is localized, these models perform recognition:

- **CRNN** — Combines CNN and RNN for sequence-based recognition
- **SAR** — Show, Attend and Read: attention-based decoder
- **MASTER** — Multi-aspect attention network for irregular text

- **ViTSTR** — Vision Transformer tailored for text recognition
- **PARSeq** — Permuted Autoregressive Sequence model
- **VIPTR** — Vision Permutable Extractor for efficient decoding
